	<p> Now we are looking at this edit taking place on the branch1 branch</p>
	<p> Ok, it looks like that workd. Now we have our p.tag edits here and they are not on the master.  I think they are on the master until you commit them? IDK, I am working through it.</p>
	<p>For real this time I have it worked out. Git will not let you switch back to master branch until you have run commit</p>

	<p> This will be a 5th p.tag to add</p>
